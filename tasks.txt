This program will do the following:
Once the user clicks the Easy / Medium / Hard mode button:
1. a random rgb color will be displayed (below the menu) 
2. circles will appear with random colors (one of them will have the value of the random rgb color displayed above). 
3. The "Click to play" button should change its text to say "New colors"
     3a. when clicked, a new random rgb color should be displayed
     3b. the circles should also change accordingly. 
If the user chooses the wrong circle:
1. the circle should turn to its other side where the word "Incorrect" with a red background should be displayed
     1a. the circle will disappear. 
If the user guesses correctly: 
1. the remaining circles will change colors to the same rgb color guessed by the user (rgb color displayed above) 
2. the background of the body should also change to that particular color 
3. the text on the main button should display "Play again?" and if clicked: 
     3a. it should reset everything
4. below the random rgb color a mesage saying "Correct!" in green should be displayed.

------------------

2. circles will appear with random colors (one of them will have the value of the random rgb color displayed above). 
If game mode is Easy then 3 circles will appear, if game mode is Medium then 6 circles will appear,
and finally if game mode is Hard then 9 circles will appear
For this to work, I need: 
a. a numberOfSquares variable

--------------------

3. In this step, we're going to setup the squares: We should pick a color from the colors array,
compare it to the color that the user picked and determine if its correct or not
The following function will be needed:
pickColor - will pick a random color from the colors array and return it
changeColors - it will accept the picked color as an argument and will change the background color
of the other circles to the picked color
setupSquares - this function will set up all squares and will call the previous functions
