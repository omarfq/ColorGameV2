# Color Game V2

This mini game is based off of Colt Steele's Web Developer Course Color Game Project. I completely redesigned the Frontend using SASS and updated the game logic accordingly. Also added an extra level (HARD) to the game.

## Getting Started

To play just click the "Click to play" button. A random RGB color will be displayed and you can choose between Easy, Medium, or Hard mode. Then choose the circle containing the color that you think is the correct one.

### Installing

The only dependency needed for this project is SASS. So you can run:

```
npm install
```

or

```
npm install node-sass --save-dev
```

## What's left to do

1. Add responsivenes to application
2. Add CSS Grid for a better organized Layout
3. Tweak the logic to make it a little bit more intuitive

## Technologies used in this Project
